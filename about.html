<p>My job title is 'Data Developer', but that doesn't tell you what I really do or what my interests and skills are! Personally, I enjoy working with all types of data: from run of the mill tabular datasets through to big, fast, messy data. Basically anything that can be used to glean information about a subject.<p>
<p>I work for <a href=www.nesta.org.uk>Nesta</a>, a charity with the goal of supporting innovation in the UK and more widely. My day job is focussed on the <a href=http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/arloesiadur-innovation-analytics-experiment>Arloesiadur</a> project, which will provide new information about innovation to policy makers in Welsh Government using cutting-edge data analytics. My role encompasses the whole of the data pipeline, from discovery through capture, storage, analysis and on to visualisation.</p>
<p>I have a 1st Class Honors degree in Geography and an MSc by Research Glaciology, both from Swansea University. My research focused on the use of a European Space Agency Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite (ENVISAT ASAR) to detect melt in the Arctic at high spatial and temporal resolutions.</p>
<p>This was my first foray into big data processing, and involved processing data several terrabytes in size. Data analysis with a geographic aspect still interests me to this day, and you'll often find me putting togther a Leaflet or OpenLayers map to visualise interesting geographic information.</p>
