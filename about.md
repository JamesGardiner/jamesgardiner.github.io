<p class="message">
  Hi, this is a personal blog that I'm using to capture some of my work on open source geospatial software such as QGIS, Leaflet or OpenLayers. Occasionally I'll look to include some Python as well.
</p>

My background is in environmental science and remote sensing - I studied Geography as an undergraduate at Swansea University and then went on to complete an MSc By Research in Glaciology, which focused on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for the detection of surface change processes on Arctic ice-caps.

I am now a Senior Consultant working for a medium-sized business based in Cardiff, South Wales. I mainly deal with web-based information systems using proprietary software, but more and more am turning to open source solutions to meet customer needs.

## Current Projects

Some of the projects that I'm currently working on include:

* Migration to [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) for desktop GIS work;
* Ongoing development of a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) geographic database using [PostGIS](http://www.postgis.net);
* Implementation of a [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org) geospatial data server in an enterprise setting; and
* Development of a number of web-maps using the popular [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) and [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org) JavaScript libraries.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jamesgardiner/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/James_G87).

Thanks for reading!
