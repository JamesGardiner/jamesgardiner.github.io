<p class="message">
  Hi! This is a blog that I'm using to capture some of my work as a Data Developer, as well as some thoughts on more generic topics.
</p>

My background is in environmental science and remote sensing - I read Geography as an undergraduate at [Swansea University](www.swasnea.ac.uk) and then studied for an MSc By Research in Glaciology, focussing on the the detection of surface change processes on Arctic ice-caps using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). I've also worked extensively in the public sector (mainly local government) focusing on the use of data to improve services.

I now work as a Data Developer for [Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/), using data from across the [data spectrum](https://theodi.org/data-spectrum) to help inform innovation policy across Wales.

### Current Projects

Here's a list of projects i'm currently working on:

* Development of an [innovation dashboard for Wales](http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/arloesiadur-innovation-analytics-experiment) (*Arloesiadur*) using new and novel data.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jamesgardiner/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/James_G87).

Thanks for reading!
